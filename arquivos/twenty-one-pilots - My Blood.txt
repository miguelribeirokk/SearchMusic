When everyone you thought you knew
Deserts your fight, I'll go with you
You're facing down a dark hall
I'll grab my light, and go with you

I'll go with you
I'll go with you
I'll go with you
I'll go with you
I'll go with you
I'll go with you
I'll go with you

Surrounded and up against a wall
I'll shred them all, and go with you
When choices end, you must defend
I'll grab my bat, and go with you

I'll go with you
I'll go with you
I'll go with you

Stay with me. No, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood. You don't need to run
Stay with me. No, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood. You don't need to run

If there comes a day
People posted up at the end of your driveway
They're calling for your head
and they're calling for your name
I'll bomb down on them, I'm coming through
Do they know I was grown with you?
If they're here to smoke, know I'll go with you
Just keep it outside, keep it outside, yeah

Stay with me. No, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood. You don't need to run
Stay with me. No, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood. You don't need to run

You don't need to run
You don't need to run
You don't need to run
You don't need to run

If you find yourself in a lion's den
I'll jump right in and pull my pin, and go with you

I'll go with you
I'll go with you
I'll go with you (You don't need to run)
I'll go with you (You don't need to run)
I'll go with you (You don't need to run)
I'll go with you, my blood, I'll go with you, yeah

Stay with me. No, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood. You don't need to run
Stay with me. No, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood. You don't need to run

You don't need to run
You don't need to run
You don't need to run
You don't need to run

Stay with me. No, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood
