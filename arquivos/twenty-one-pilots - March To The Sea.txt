There's miles of land in front of us
And we're dying with every step we take
We're dying with every breath we make
And I'll fall in line

A stranger's back is all I see
He's only a few feet in front of me
And I'll look left and right sometimes
But I'll fall in line

No one looks up anymore
'Cause you might get a raindrop in your eye
And Heaven forbid they see you cry
As we fall in line

And about this time every year
The line will go to the ocean pier
And walk right off into the sea
And then we fall asleep

And as we near the end of land
And our ocean graves are just beyond the sand
I ask myself the question
Why I fall in line

Then out of the corner of my eye
I see a spaceship in the sky
And hear a voice inside my head
Follow me instead

Then the wages of war will start
Inside my head with my counterpart
And the emotionless marchers will chant the phrase
This line's the only way

And then I start down the stand
My eyes are focused on the end of land
But again the voice inside my head says
Follow me instead

Take me up, seal the door
I don't want to march here anymore
I realize that this line is dead
So I'll follow You instead

So then You put me back in my place
So I might start another day
And once again I will be
In a march to the sea
