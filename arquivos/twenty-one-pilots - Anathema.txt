You will never know
What's behind my skull
So won't you say goodnight
So I can say goodbye

You will never know
What's under my hair
So won't you say goodnight
So I can say goodbye

You will never know
What's under my skin
So won't you say goodnight
So I can say goodbye

You will never know
What is in my veins
So won't you say goodnight
so I can say goodbye

Won't you go to someone else's dreams?
Won't you go to someone else's head?
Haven't you taken enough from me?
Won't you torture someone else's sleep?

And you will never know
What I'm thinking of
So won't you say goodnight
So I can say goodbye

And you will never understand
What I believe
So won't you say goodnight
So I can say goodbye

Haven't you taken enough from me?
Won't you torture someone else's sleep?
Won't you go to someone else's dreams?
Won't you go to someone else's head?
Haven't you taken enough from me?
Won't you torture someone else's sleep?

I start to part two halves
Of my heart in the dark and I
Don't know where I should go
And the tears and the fears
Begin to multiply
Taking time in a simple place
In my bed Where my head
rests on a pillowcase
And it's said that a war's lead
but I forget
And I let another day go by
I want to be afraid
but it seems that these days
I'm caught under water
and I'm falling farther
My heart's getting harder,
I'm calling my father
Am I screaming to an empty sky?
Empty sky, no way, that's me
'Cause one half of my heart is free
Empty sky, no way, that's me
'Cause the other half of my heart's asleep
