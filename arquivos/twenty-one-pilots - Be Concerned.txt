Where'd you go, huh?
They all think I know you,
It's so hard to motivate,
Me to devote a,
Single inch of me to,
Something I can't see I,
Don't mean to pry but why,
Would you even make the eyes?
I don't believe my ears,
And I'm scared of my own head,
I will deny you for years,
Then I'll make you raise me from the dead,
And if I said that I would live for you,
For nothing in return,
Well I'm sorry Mr. Gullible,
But lying's all I've learned,
So be concerned.
No music,
And I could talk about anything,
Whether or not it's worthwhile,
Is based on who's listening,
Most of us listen if it's,
Something we can relate to,
All of us relate,
If it's something we've just been through,
Take it for granted,
Trust is damaged and now we panic,
Living empty-handed,
Living lives like we can't manage, I can't feel you,
But still know where home is feeling like Jonah did,
Almost dropped the bat like every base was fully loaded.
I am disappearing,
Inside my bird's eye theories,
I try to say goodbye, defy, and deny,
What it is I'm fearing,
Clearly I am dying, dearly I am writing,
Merely testifying, that the test to fly requires I,
Pass the test with colors flying,
I don't believe you most the time,
I'm lying 'cause I say I am fine,
You are the pearl, I am the swine,
So break my life and take this rhyme,
I'm so sorry but I do believe,
That all my bridges, I have burned,
And I've earned a policy of no return,
So be concerned.
