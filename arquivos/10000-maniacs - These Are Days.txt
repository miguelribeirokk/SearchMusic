These are
These are days you'll remember
Never before and never since, I promise
Will the whole world be warm as this
And as you feel it,
You'll know it's true
That you - you are blessed and lucky
It's true - that you
Are touched by something
That will grow and bloom in you

These are days you'll remember
When May is rushing over you
With desire to be part of the miracles
You see in every hour
You'll know it's true
That you are blessed and lucky
It's true that you are touched
By something that will grow and bloom in you

These are days
These are the days you might fill
With laughter until you break
These days you might feel
A shaft of light
Make its way across your face
And when you do
You'll know how it was meant to be
See the signs and know their meaning
You'll know how it was meant to be
Hear the signs and know they're speaking
To you, to you
