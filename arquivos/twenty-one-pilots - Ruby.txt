Ruby, I hope I see you
I've waited all this week
For you to walk my way
Your soul will capture me

Your momma painted your room
A shade of pink, she said
But with your great arrival
That shade has turned to red

Ruby, take my hand
Please lead me to the promise land
Tell me, where am I from
Your eyes say,
Sha-da-di-da-dum

Ruby, you're royalty
In your homeland they all call you queen
Tell me, where are you from?
Your eyes say,
Sha-da-di-da-dum

You're an angel fallen down
Won't you tell us of the clouds
You have fallen from the sky
How high, how high?

You're true and pure
You hold the cure
We're all diseased
You hold the key

You're an angel fallen down
Won't you tell us of the clouds
You have fallen from the sky
How high, how high?

Tell our dad I'm sorry

You're an angel

Tell our dad I'm sorry
